Jupyter Notebooks
=================

Here are some notebooks.  Here is a nice introduction to
`Jupyter Notebooks <https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks>`_.  While you can download and run the notebooks on your local computer,
you may find it more convenient to run them on
`Google Colaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb>`_.
To do so, click on the Open in Colab badge on the given notebook page.
This option does require you to have a
`Google Account <https://www.google.com/account/about/>`_.

Nuclear Astrophysics.
---------------------

Nucleosynthesis
...............

`NRLEE Nucleosynthesis <https://github.com/mbradle/NRLEE-Nucleosynthesis>`_.
This notebook explores NRLEE nucleosynthesis.

`(n,gamma)-(gamma,n) equilibrium <https://github.com/mengkel/ng-gn-abundances>`_.
(n,gamma)-(gamma,n) equilibrium is an important phase of r-process nucleosynthesis.  This notebook studies that phase in some detail.

`ww95 <https://github.com/mbradle/ww95>`_.
This notebook explores the Woosley and Weaver (1995) stellar yields from
massive stars.

Stellar Structure
------------------

`Lane Emden Equation <https://github.com/jaadt7/Lane_Emden>`_.
This notebook explores solutions to the Lane-Emden equation and applications to
physical polytropes.


Webnucleo XML
-------------

`Create nuclide XML <https://github.com/mbradle/create_nuclide_xml>`_.
This notebook allows users to create webnucleo nuclear data XML from their
own data.

`Create reaction XML <https://github.com/mbradle/create_reaction_xml>`_.
