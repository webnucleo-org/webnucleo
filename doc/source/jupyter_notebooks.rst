Jupyter Notebooks
=================

Here are some notebooks.  Here is a nice introduction to
`Jupyter Notebooks <https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks>`_.  While you can download and run the notebooks on your local computer,
you may find it more convenient to run them on
`Google Colaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb>`_.
To do so, click on the Open in Colab badge on the given notebook page.
This option does require you to have a
`Google Account <https://www.google.com/account/about/>`_.

Many of the notebooks run on `Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ as well.

Nuclear Astrophysics.
---------------------

Nucleosynthesis
...............

`Mainline Stellar Nucleosynthesis <https://github.com/mbradle/mainline-nucleosynthesis>`_.
This notebook explores mainline stellar nucleosynthesis nucleosynthesis in simple constant temperature and density models.

`Simple s-Process Nucleosynthesis <https://github.com/mbradle/simple_s_process>`_.
This notebook explores s-process nucleosynthesis in constant neutron-number density models.

`NRLEE Nucleosynthesis <https://github.com/mbradle/NRLEE-Nucleosynthesis>`_.
This notebook explores NRLEE nucleosynthesis.

`(n,gamma)-(gamma,n) equilibrium <https://github.com/mengkel/ng-gn-abundances>`_.
(n,gamma)-(gamma,n) equilibrium is an important phase of r-process nucleosynthesis.  This notebook studies that phase in some detail.

`ww95 <https://github.com/mbradle/ww95>`_.
This notebook explores the Woosley and Weaver (1995) stellar yields from
massive stars.

`Isomer Intuition <https://github.com/jaadt7/isomer_intuition>`_.
This notebook explores the evolution of a long-lived nuclear isomer interacting
with its ground state in temperature varying environments.

Stellar Structure
------------------

`Lane Emden Equation <https://github.com/jaadt7/Lane_Emden>`_.
This notebook explores solutions to the Lane-Emden equation and applications to
physical polytropes.

`Newton-Raphson <https://github.com/jaadt7/Newton_Raphson>`_.
This notebook demonstrates the use of the Newton-Raphson technique to solve
coupled differential equations that occur, for example, in solving for
models of stellar structure.

Webnucleo XML
-------------

`Webnucleo XML <https://github.com/mbradle/webnucleo_xml>`_.  This project
includes a set of
notebooks that allow users to convert their own data into XML files appropriate
for Webnucleo projects.

`Plot reaction XML <https://github.com/mbradle/plot_reaction_xml>`_.
This notebook allows users to plot webnucleo XML reaction data.

`Trim nuclear network XML by solar <https://github.com/mbradle/trim_network_by_solar>`_.
This notebook allows users to trim a webnucleo nuclear reaction network relative to the naturally-occurring isotopes.

`Neutron-capture cross sections
<https://github.com/mbradle/Neutron_Capture_Cross_Sections>`_.
This notebook allows users to compute neutron-capture cross sections from Webnucleo XML
network data for selected sets of nuclei at a given temperature.

Cosmochemistry
--------------

`rsp_mix <https://github.com/mbradle/rsp_mix>`_.
This notebook computes isotopic anomalies arising from different mixtures of r-, s-, and p-process contributions and can compare those computed anomalies to meteoritic data.
